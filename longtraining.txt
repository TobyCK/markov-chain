Computers have become so necessary to modern living that it is difficult to believe that they are a relatively recent invention. We cannot live without computers, as they are involved in most of the everyday options. It’s really hard to imagine a life without computers. In schools, students use computers to learn and teachers use computer in their teachings. All they need to do is just sit in front of the monitor and click the mouse. That means computers make the learning and teaching processes more efficient. As a result, students are all better educated. Although some people may complain students of becoming less concentrated on the lessons if computers are used, it is not the problem of using computers. That is the problem of the students’ behaviours. We cannot blame the computers, as it is the responsibility of students. In offices, businessmen use computers to trade with other companies, especially those who are overseas. They can communicate with each other in a short time. Thus, trades can be finished in a more efficient way. Besides, they can collect the most up-to-date financial information from the Internet so that they can make the best decision. Moreover, computers are used to control the operation of machines. Therefore, the productivity of companies can be highly increased. According to a survey report, the computer-related medical claims had a 5% increase within the last two years, therefore it suggested us not to use computers in offices. However, illnesses are brought by the inappropriate computer-aid working facilities. Illnesses can be combated by using ergonomic desks or chairs. In transportations, computers are used to control trains, ships and even the planes. The use of computers makes the itinerary more steady and safe. Since these computer systems are very reliable, pressures of the divers can be reduced. On the other hand, computers are used to control the traffic lights. They can accurately assign time for pedestrians and vehicles. They contribute to our transport system. It is believed that computer system may be out of order, and unreliable. We should not rely on them too much. It may be true to a certain extent. However the convenience that computer brought to us cannot be neglected. Also they rarely become out of order. Since the convenience out weight the problems, computers still bring us more benefits. Furthermore, computers together with Internet save one’s time. That is we can pay the electricity, telephone, water, and town gas bills without going out. We can make appointments through the Internet too, e.g. making smart ID and booking of stadium. Also we can renew books. All these services are provided simply just by logging into your own account. Although hackers may log on to personal data in some web’s database, most of the government webs and bank webs have set up a well-secured computer system to protect customers’ personal data. Therefore we don’t need to worry about that. To conclude, computers are our tools to create a better society to live in. They have already taken a vital role in our society. This only means computers bring us more benefits than problems. In today’s world, science is just not a word, in every aspect of our life there must be some role that science plays. In every point of our life, we must use some machine, some scientific things which we do even not know that it is included in our daily ways. We must say that science came a long way from ancient time to the present day of our life. Nowadays, science has no limit. Science is a Latin word which means knowledge. Science has roots from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3500 to 3000 BCE. Science is the reason behind our success to reach on Moon, Mars and other parts of the space. At the present time, we are able to get the knowledge about various parts of the universe. The term scientist was given by Willam Whewell in 1883. Scientist are the ones who conduct scientific research to extend the knowledge as per their area of interest. There are many scientists like Galileo Galilei (referred as the father of modern astronomy and the father of modern physics), Sir Isaac Newton who gave Newtonian mechanics, equation of motion and many more, Albert Einstein who gave us the theory of relativity which is one of the two pillars of modern physics and he also gave popular philosophy, Marie Curie, Charles Darwin, C.V. Raman, Srinivasa Ramanujan and many more. In previous time there was no medium of communication from one part of the world to another. But in the present time, there is a mobile phone, laptop, computers, satellite, etc. through which we can communicate with anyone at any time at any place. The computer and laptops that we use today so travel friendly that we can carry laptops in our bags. But when the first computer made by Charles Babbage was introduced it was too large that we cannot move that computer. After many further invention leads to the modern computer, we use nowadays. In the case of computer, science came a long way. Mobile is another gadget which is a gift of science. Because of mobile, we are able to communicate through any person by our voice. Even because of this, any two-person can talk face to face sitting at their respective places. All invention is only because of science. Once that was the time when if any person needs to travel, it just takes lots of time to reach the destination but at present because of the aeroplane, train it takes very less time to travel. In communication, these are the basics we use. There are various branch of science. These are physics, chemistry, biology, social science, and many more. In physics, there are numerous branches which includes mechanics, optics, electronics and the most important astrophysics. Because of physics, we are now able to make cars, aeroplanes, house appliances and many others. It is a gift of science that now we are able to cure any disease like cancer with the help of medicine and by doing operations. Our science technology improves at such extent that in past human did not know that how fire catches but at present with just one matchstick fire catches in just a few seconds. Although science is very useful for us but for every time? Maybe not. Although science technology like mobile is very useful in terms of communication but the excess use of mobile is not good especially for children. Laptop, computer and mobiles are losing interest in the outdoor game which is not good for children’s physical improvement. In fact, the excess use of mobile causes the loss of their mental growth. Lots of invention in science technology led to the loss of life also. The inventions of bomb, weapon and many gadgets like guns etc. cause a loss of innocent lives. Suppose when a bomb is released by terrorist, thousands of innocent people loss their lives. Not only human but animal suffer also because of this technology. Because of mobile tower radiation birds experience electromagnetic force when they pass by the tower and this force is very harmful for them which causes the extinction of birds and bees from that area. Even these rays are harmful for human also. Some product which includes radioactive materials are very injurious for the human body and even cause cancer which led to the loss of lives. Mathematics is one of the common subjects that we study since our childhood. It is generally used in our daily life. Every person needs to learn some basics of it. Even counting money also includes math. Every work is linked with math in some way or the other. A person who does math is called a Mathematician. Mathematics can be divided into two parts. The first is Pure mathematics, and the second is Applied mathematics. In Pure mathematics, we need to study the basic concept and structures of mathematics. But, on the other side, Applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to solve problems that arise in various areas,(e.g.), science, engineering, and so on. One couldn’t imagine the world without math. Math makes our life systematic, and every invention involves math. No matter what action a person is doing, he should know some basic maths. Every profession involves maths. Our present-day world runs on computers, and even computer runs with the help of maths. Every development that happens requires math. Mathematics has a wide range of applications in our daily life. Maths generally deals with numbers. There are various topics in math, such as trigonometry; integration; differentiation, etc. All the subjects such as physics; chemistry; economy; commerce involve maths in some way or the other. Math is also used to find the relation between two numbers, and math is considered to be one of the most challenging subjects to learn. Math includes various numbers, and many symbols are used to show the relation between two different numbers. Math is complicated to learn, and one needs to focus and concentrate more. Math is logical sometimes, and the logic needs to be derived out. Maths make our life easier and more straightforward. Math is considered to be challenging because it consists of many formulas that have to be learned, and many symbols and each symbol generally has its significance. New Zealand is a land of magnificent and unordinary beauty. This is a wonderful place to learn English, enjoy nature and go mountain-skiing. It is no secret that "The Lord of The Rings" was shot in New Zealand – the nature of New Zealand so closely resembles the magical country! If you are keen on active tourism, you can find all the necessary facilities for hiking, mountain-skiing, rafting and many other kinds of sports here. The country’s distinguishing characteristic is the beauty of its nature. Make your dreams come true! Swim together with dolphins, admire whales, and go fishing! New Zealand is an island country but the sizes of the islands are not large, so it is quite easy and pleasant to travel about/around (not really sure of ‘about/around) regardless of what means of transport you use – a car, a bus, or even a bicycle. New Zealand culture is quite unordinary. New Zealanders represent a mix of Europeans and the Maoris. They are very friendly and hospitable. A foreigner will be surprised by being greeted on the street by complete strangers. The atmosphere of relaxation and peacefulness prevails everywhere in New Zealand. The murder rate is extremely low compared to any other country of the world and the bribery rate among governmental workers is the lowest in the world (supposedly, there is no such thing as bribes in New Zealand at all). By the way, governmental ministers do not have body guards or escorts. Naturally, making an appointment with one of them is quite easy. Sometimes you can even meet a minister while standing in line in a supermarket. Another practical thing you should know about when you are in New Zealand – you should not give tips in hotels, restaurants etc. because tips are uncommon here. The local art and culture originated by combining things that cannot normally be combined, hence their passing resemblance to common cultures and arts. Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, is situated in the wonderful harbor on the edge of the "Northern" island. Guidebooks recommend paying particular attention to the following sights. These are: the modernistic building of the executive branch of the Parliament – Beehive, the ancient building of the government (one of the biggest buildings in the world made completely from wood), the National Library with an excellent collection of literature, Catherine Mansfield’s Memorial, and more. There are a few interesting museums such as the Maori Museum called "Te Papa" in Wellington. But the place that is definitely worth a visit is located not far from the capital. It is Mount Victoria. You can come in sight of the mountain from the city’s streets. What an impressive sight!mWhat is the best time to go to New Zealand? Owing to the favorable location, New Zealand’s climate is fairly mild the whole year, so you can visit the country any time of the year. However, they usually emphasize the “main” season – November through April. There are a lot of tourists arriving at this time of the year, so it is quite reasonable to reserve a hotel room in advance. If you like mountain-skiing, the best time for you to come is winter – June through August. In general, if you can come any time of the year, we advise you come before or after the main season. The weather is pretty warm but there are no crowds of tourists and you can go sightseeing anywhere you want without having to care about the availability of tickets. Today there are about 7 billion people in this world. With that many people it is pretty amazing that each one of us is unique in our own way. Contrast to our individualities, however, we tend to create this “perfect person” that everyone should aim to achieve within our societies. By doing this we almost set ourselves up for failure, seeing that nothing in life is perfect. However, what a lot of people don’t realize is that imperfections and individualities that are in all of us and are the free measure at our successes in life. Being a leader rather than a follower is something not many people know the difference between. Politics is a great example; it is a good thing that we have different parties so we can get the opinions from a different side. However, religion is another topic where individuality is key. Our society considers someone who stands up for their faith and doesn’t back down an accomplished person; yet frowns upon it in schools.  Contrary to what we should do, society tends to rate and judge others greatly. Though we may be a bit different and differ in opinions we all should be treated equally, just as our founding fathers wrote it. The society we have built for today scares many people because we are sometimes subconsciously told to be a certain way or to do a certain thing and we are losing our ability at freedom to be who we are.

The society we have built for today scares many people because we are sometimes subconsciously told to be a certain way or to do a certain thing and we are losing our ability at freedom to be who we are. Expressing yourself is a great thing but there is a line that has to be drawn between what people are telling you and what your actual beliefs are. Today what is shown on TV, magazines, or any kid of media site is ridiculous. The celebrities that our children look up to are stars doing drugs, alcohol, dancing in disturbing. If children are being told that this is what our society likes, they might be scared to admit their true selves. Fitness and health is a wonderful thing, and people really should be healthy; but to a certain extent. The fact that kids, young teenage girls in particular are harming themselves or starving themselves because they don’t look like a supermodel they saw in a magazine causes serious mental and emotional problems. How much of an impact our world can have on us, causing diseases such as Bulimia, or causing young men to take steroids, is an extremely unappealing thought. Embracing uniqueness and individuality is ideally what should be encouraged. Maybe you didn’t get into the smartest college, or have the biggest house, but you should be proud of yourself for trying because growing up in this world can be difficult, like Emerson once said "to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment". I agree with that 100 percent. The relationship between religion and politics continues to be an important topic in modern American society. In a radical act, the Constitution not only guaranteed religious freedom, it also stated that the United States would not have a national church and would not have religious tests for the national office. However, in American political life there are factors that enhance the role of religion in a way that isn’t observed in other developed countries. In the article “How Politics Affects Religion: Partisanship, Socialization, and Religiosity in America,” Michele F. Margolis highlights the theory of the life cycle of religion and politics. Scholars point out that social identities can shape political attitudes and behaviors. This article explores the feedback, whether there are strong sides of party identity in order to influence engagement in a politically important social group. Politics can affect the level of religiosity at a certain time in their lives, “when people are in the process of raising children – a time that encourages many to make decisions associated with their religious identities – their partisanship may in?uence these religious choices”. The article “Christian Theology and Attitudes Toward Political and Religious Ideological Groups,” examines the influence of Christian theology on the attitudes toward different ideological groups, both political and religious. These articles address some of the problems that arise in different ways between religion and politics. In the United States, religious identity often correlates with political identity, because religious differences are clearly visible in party politics. Politics is not only a competition for power, and not only a selection of performers; it is a base of values on how to live together. In many ways, today’s America is more Christian than any previous moment in its history. Christianity is responsible for the way our society is organized and for the way we currently live. Christian contribution is extensive to our laws, our economics, our politics, our arts, our calendar, our holidays, and our moral and cultural priorities. In the article “How Politics Affects Religion: Partisanship, Socialization, and Religiosity in America,” Michele F. Margolis examines how a party identity affects the involvement of an important social group in politics. Religion is not only identity, but it is often the main component of political views in the United States. The relationship between religion and politics has changed dramatically over the last four decades. A new party coalition is created based on religiosity or religious participation. Religious socialization shows people’s relationships with religion – marked by membership and involvement in formal institutions – change as they develop and age. The religious life-cycle theory argues that teenagers and young adults distance themselves from both the religion in which they were raised and religious practice in general. Across multiple generations, young adults are the least likely to identify with a religious tradition, attend religious services, pray, and report religion being an important part of their lives, and decreases in religiosity occur across region of residence, religious denomination, relationship with parents, and parents’ religiosities. After comparing statistics data, it’s pretty clear that during period from 1965 to 1973, students belonging to both Republican and Democratic parties attended church nearly twice less often. There is often noticeable return to religion and to religious participation after marriage and during time of educating children, but sometimes it doesn’t happen at all. Religious identity and religious participation are pretty stable at the mature age . Party spirit can have an effect on religiosity. “The ‘impressionable years’ hypothesis claims – as the name suggests – that adolescents and young adults are highly impressionable and that outside influences and events can shape young people’s political outlooks, including partisan identification. The partyhood that is developing in young people’s lives is more than a political party, a powerful identity that often lasts a lifetime and influences other settings and behavior. The partnership generates economic assessments, confidence in the government, a sense of fairness in elections, consumption and spending. In America the Republican party associated with organized religious groups and religious values, while the Democratic party considered to be less religious and offer more liberal points of view. As religiosity became relevant to politics, religious voters became republicans, and less religious voters became democrats. The theory of the life cycle explains that politician can form a religious choice of the parties for their advantage in order to get votes. Politics can affect the level of religiosity at a certain time or stage of our life. George Yancey, Marie A. Eisenstein, and Ryan P. Burge, in “Christian Theology and Attitudes Toward Political and Religious Ideological Groups”, have shown the influence of Christian theology on attitudes towards different ideological groups, both political and religious. The study describes how religious affiliation, behavior and belief in the United States affect voting and political party affiliation. Progressive Christians more often show an unfavorable attitude towards groups with political differences than conservative Christians. "The values of progressive Christians and their denominations have moved from claims of absolutism to an emphasis on tolerance and acceptance". On the other hand, conservative Christians more often show a negative attitude toward groups with religious differences compared with progressive Christians. Therefore, theological differences between Christians are often divided into different levels of conservatism and progressivism. "Progressive Christians emphasize human [desire] and tolerance as the source of their values". Rationality and human wisdom play important role when making choices and facing different social problems. Conservative Christians, as opposed to progressive, rely on “authoritative scripture as the last word of their moral vision". They stick to traditional thinking, according to which their beliefs should match with the information in the Bible. The importance of God’s word is a valuable indicator of the various Christian views and they form their attitude towards other political or religious groups. The adoption of the Bible as the greatest authority makes conservative Christians less prepared to be flexible in their search for truth. "This critical theological difference means conservative Christians are less likely to adopt modern social innovations such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and divorce, in part due to their allegiances to traditional values and practices in the Bible". Those who adopt a progressive form of Christianity may prioritize political goals more than those adopting a conservative Christian ideology. Although the United States is at the same time religiously diverse and very religious, "interreligious relations exhibit more comity than conflict". Modern Democrats usually refer to values of justice, tolerance, and the republicans to traditional conservative views. In America, religion is an important part of social life. Despite the constitutional dividing wall between church and state, national politicians refer to religion in great speeches. The President always asks God to bless America, sending his prayers to the victims of the disaster, accepting religious leaders and praising religious values. Such propaganda of religion is unheard of in Europe, but it may be because the majority is not religious and the native populations, as opposed to immigrants, are not very religious. The Christians of the United States under the banner of “the moral majority” have made a significant movement to influence political leaders since the 1970s and introduced religion into political debate. The religious disposition of immigrants mean that they are receptive to the conservative religious message and can be persuaded to vote across class lines. By doing that they support an agenda that favors the wealthy and makes them even poorer. American politicians talk a lot about religion. Nevertheless, they have nothing to do with theocracy, such as the Taliban. Paradoxically, the US conservatives went to war in Afghanistan to separate religion from politics abroad while strivnig to unite religion and politics at home. Many poor people in America risk losing their economic interests by voting for republican politicians who are interested in further concentrating wealth in the hands of the rich. They do so partially because the republicans appeal to their religious ideology. Studies show that democrats are less religious than republicans. This pattern arose from the fact that religious beliefs affect political identity, but there is also a reverse relationship. These articles show that religious relations can be formed by political identities. Partyhood tends to crystallize at a young age and early adulthood, when most young people in the United States move away from religion in which they were brought up and religious practice in general. However, when young people move into adulthood, they must decide whether to stay out of religion or return to the religious sphere. Political identity, which for many has been built since the young years, can help to form a new religious identity. The religious belonging increases in uncertain lives of the poor, since difficult living conditions are associated with increased religiousness. The worse their living conditions are the greater chances they will support the leading party. This seems to be another great reason for separating the church from the state. Party divisions for republicans and democrats do not simply reflect social disagreements, but they also help to create them. Americans can rely on their commitment to religious decisions, as long as parties and party elites recognize differences in issues related to religion and morals. The theory of the life cycle gives an explanation when politics most likely affects religion at the individual level, rejecting the assumption that politics should have a single effect for different types of people. Can you imagine living in a world where the most abundant and needed resource water was not available to you? This is the reality many people around the world are facing right now. Globalization has brought people of different cultures together and developed a new era in economic prosperity. However, globalization has some areas of concern, such as water scarcity, climate change, water pollution, and deforestation. Economic growth, population shifts, and climate change will contribute to severe shortage and degradation of global water supplies. Water is critical for many businesses because all goods require water in their production. As one of the world’s largest agricultural countries.

Economic growth, population shifts, and climate change will contribute to severe shortage and degradation of global water supplies. Water is critical for many businesses because all goods require water in their production. As one of the world’s largest agricultural countries. China is faced with serious water scarcity due to the high population growth every year, while some regions of the world see danger through extensive droughts or water diseases. Also, the inability of public people has brought a rise in water-services privatization contracts between foreign investors and states. As an agricultural country, China needs more water resources to meet its local needs of growing domestic consumption. Currently, China is facing a shortage of water due to climate and rapid development. It’s a water shortage country as the per capita use of water resources of China is only 2,300 cubic meters, which is one of the world’s 13 most water-poor countries. The agricultural land use was reduced in 11 regions, of which four were absolute water scarcity regions, two water scarcity regions, and ?ve water relative rich regions. We can end that the seven important crop planting regions including Henan, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Sichuan, Anhui, Hebei, and Jiangsu were water resource relative scarcity regions in the year 2007. Water resources aren’t managed sustainably in many parts of the world, lower groundwater table lead to desertification, problem of diffuse water pollution from agriculture. According to the World Water Council, 1.1 billion people in the world do not have appropriate drinking water and sanitation facilities, while 2.6 billion are without improved sanitation facilities, and over 5000 people die each day from water-related diseases, according to World Water Assessment Programme 2003. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico are getting depleted and Yemen could run of water in the next few years. “Taking a shorter shower is not the answer” to the global problem, said Hoekstra, a Dutch American Politician as one to four percent of person water footprint is in home while twenty-five percent person water footprint is through meat consumption. It takes fifteen thousand liters of water to make 1kg of beef.
